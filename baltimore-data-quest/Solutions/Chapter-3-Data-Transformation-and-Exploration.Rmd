# 🎭 Chapter 03 – Data Transformation & Exploration

Welcome to the **Hall of Insight**.

You’ve cleared the fog around your data, but now something lurks in the corridors of your cleaned dataset:\
**patterns hidden across time, genre, language, and popularity.**

To face the Phantom of Patterns, you need to **group, summarize, and visualize** your data so you can see what was invisible before.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Create a code chunk and read in your movie dataset below**

```{r}
movies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jabirG/Tidy-Tuesday-Horror-Movies-Dataset/refs/heads/main/horror_movies.csv")

```
## 🎯 Objectives for This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to:

1.  Group data with `group_by()`.
2.  Summarize patterns with `summarise()`.
3.  Create new columns with `mutate()`.
4.  Use `arrange()` and `count()` to organize insights.
5.  Make your **first visualization using ggplot2**.
6.  Defeat the **Phantom of Patterns**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🗺️ Stage 1: Grouping & Summarizing

The Phantom of Patterns scatters insights across categories.\
To fight back, you must **bring order**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Exercise: Average Revenue by Genre

Using your **movies dataset**:

```{r}
movies |>
  group_by(genre_names) |>
  summarise(avg_revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE))
```
> **Data Points Earned: 10**
> *(Beginner – Grouping and Summarizing)*

---

# 🛠 Stage 2: Create New Powers with `mutate()`

Sometimes the raw data isn’t enough. You need **derived columns**.

---

## 🧩 Exercise: Create a Profit Column

```{r}
movies |>
  mutate(profit = revenue - budget) |>
  arrange(desc(profit))
```

Now you can see the **biggest hits**!

> **Data Points Earned: 15** *(Intermediate – Derived Variables)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🏷 Stage 3: Count and Rank

The Phantom thrives on **overwhelming numbers**. Use `count()` to see where the data clusters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Count Original Languages

```{r}
movies |>
  count(original_language, sort = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🎨 Stage 4: The Weapon of Sight – `ggplot2`

Visualization lets you **see the Phantom’s shape**.

We’ll look at **popularity trends over time**.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

movies |>
  mutate(year = year(release_date)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

> **Data Points Earned: 20** *(Intermediate – First Visualization)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ⚔️ Mini-Boss Fight – The Phantom of Patterns

**Description:** The Phantom confuses you by spreading patterns across genres, languages, and years. To beat it, **spot trends that aren’t obvious just by looking at rows**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Your Mission**

**Objective:** Create a small report answering these:

1.  Which genre has the **highest average profit**?
2.  In what **year** were movies most popular (average popularity)?
3.  Does **language** seem to affect average vote_average?

**Instructions:**

1.  Use `mutate()` to create a profit column.
2.  Use `group_by()` + `summarise()` to answer each question.
3.  Create at least **one ggplot** to visualize a trend you discover.

You can work in **chunks**:

```{r}
# Example skeleton
movies |>
  mutate(profit = revenue - budget) |>
  group_by(genre_names) |>
  summarise(avg_profit = mean(profit, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_profit))
```

When you’ve extracted **3 insights**, the Phantom dissipates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Reward for Victory**

-   **40 Data Points**
-   Badge: **Pattern Breaker**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 Reflection

Write down:

-   One insight that surprised you.
-   One function you now feel comfortable using.
-   One function that still confuses you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 📜 End of Chapter 3

You’ve learned:

-   How to group, summarize, and visualize data
-   How to **make patterns visible**
-   How to build a report to fight confusion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Prepare for Chapter 4:** In the next chapter, we’ll **level up your visual skills** and learn how to communicate your findings as a story using advanced `ggplot2` techniques.
