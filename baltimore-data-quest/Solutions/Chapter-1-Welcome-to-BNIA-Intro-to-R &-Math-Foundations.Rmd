# 🎮 Stage 1: Welcome + Using the BNIA Website

Welcome to your **first adventure** as a data explorer!  
This is where you learn that **real-world data lives in places like BNIA (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance).**

> **BNIA Website:** [https://bniajfi.org](https://bniajfi.org)

---

## 🕹️ Mini-Mission: Explore the BNIA Website

1. Visit **BNIA**.
2. Click on **"Vital Signs"**.
3. Locate your **Community Statistical Area (CSA)**.
4. Browse through different **Indicators** — pick one that interests you.

*This step is about getting familiar with where data comes from, not analyzing it yet.*

> **Data Points Earned: 10** *(Beginner – Familiarization)*

# ⚔️ Stage 2: Why Learn R?

R is a programming language made **specifically for statistics and data**.  
Before we analyze Baltimore data, we must learn the **language of numbers**.

> Data scientists are like detectives: R is your magnifying glass, and math is your logic.

---

# 🏗 Stage 3: Assigning Values – Objects

The most basic thing in R: **assignment**.

```{r}
# Assign a number to an object
x <- 5

# Assign a word (text) to an object
name <- "BNIA"

# Assign a vector (a group of values)
scores <- c(85, 90, 95)
```

---

# 📊 Stage 4: Math in R

R was made for math. Try these:

```{r}
# Mean (average)
mean(scores)

# Median (middle value)
median(scores)

# Minimum and Maximum
min(scores)
max(scores)

# Sum
sum(scores)

# Standard deviation (how spread out)
sd(scores)
```

These **built-in functions** will be your best friends.
Anytime you have a set of numbers, you can summarize them quickly.

> **Pro Tip:** Never be afraid of math in R. The language was created for it.

---

# 🧩 Quick Practice

Try:

1. Create an object called `ages` with 5 numbers of your choice.
2. Use `mean()`, `median()`, and `sd()` on `ages`.

---

# 🔮 Stage 5: Using Built-in Data

R has **built-in datasets** ready to explore. For example, `mtcars`:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

This dataset is about cars: miles per gallon, horsepower, weight, etc.

# 🧙‍♂️ Mini-Boss Fight – The Statistician’s Ghost

**Description:**
The Statistician’s Ghost tries to confuse you by hiding patterns in **numbers**.
Your task: use R’s math functions to reveal them.

---

### **Your Mission**

Using the `mtcars` dataset:

1. Find the **average mpg (miles per gallon)**.
2. Find the **median horsepower (hp)**.
3. Find the **minimum and maximum weight (wt)**.
4. Use `sd()` to see how much mpg varies.

Write your answers in a code chunk:

```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
median(mtcars$hp)
min(mtcars$wt)
max(mtcars$wt)
sd(mtcars$mpg)
```

---

**Victory Condition:**
Once you answer all 5, the Ghost vanishes.

**Reward:**

* 40 Data Points
* Badge: **Math Adept**

---

# 🧠 Reflection

* Which math function surprised you?
* Which one do you think will be most useful in data analysis?
