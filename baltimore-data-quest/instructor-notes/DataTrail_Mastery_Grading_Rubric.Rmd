# 🔺 DataTrail Mastery Grading Rubric

This rubric governs all grading criteria for:

-   Front-End Chapters (1–5)
-   Back-End Chapters (1–5)
-   Side Quests (Beginner to Advanced)
-   Final Boss Project

It also maps total Data Points (DP) to mastery **Ranks** inspired by the Solo Leveling system—but redesigned to reflect **DataTrail growth, grit, and clarity**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌟 Mastery Rank System (DataTrail Edition)

| **Rank** | **Total DP** Range | **Meaning** |
|----|----|----|
| **S Rank** | 950–1000+ | Full mastery. Clean, creative, and clear. A student others look up to. |
| **A Rank** | 850–949 | Advanced fluency. Solid technical, creative, and narrative control. |
| **B Rank** | 700–849 | Good understanding. Missed small pieces or lacked storytelling clarity. |
| **C Rank** | 600–699 | Understands basics. Some growth still needed with consistency. |
| **D Rank** | 500–599 | Effort is visible, but foundational gaps need to be filled. |
| **F Rank** | Below 500 | Needs major reinforcement. Likely skipped material or rushed. |

> 🎓 Ranks are announced at graduation and shown with each student's final boss project.
