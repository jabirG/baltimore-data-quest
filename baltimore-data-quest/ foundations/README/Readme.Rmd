# Foundation Module

Welcome to the **Foundation** folder of this curriculum! This directory is designed as the learning basecamp for students participating in this program, especially those analyzing Baltimore neighborhood data using BNIA datasets.

## Purpose

The goal of the Foundation module is to provide:

1. **Essential R and tidyverse skills** to succeed in later modules.
2. **Function-specific breakdowns** that match the challenges you'll face in each module.
3. A **build-your-own-adventure style** structure where more advanced students can fast-track through concepts they know, while beginners are guided step-by-step.

## What's Inside?

The Foundation folder contains a series of `.Rmd` (R Markdown) files built around the first 16 chapters of the *R for Data Science (2nd Edition)* book. These are structured to:

* Explain **core tidyverse functions** such as `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `summarise()`, and `group_by()`.
* Provide **examples and exercises** that mimic real-world applications, especially using data similar to or from the BNIA repository.
* Use **Jabir Ghaffar's solutions** as annotated templates to help students understand how to apply each concept.

## How to Use This

* **Start with Chapter 1** and move forward in order unless you’re confident enough to skip ahead.
* Each `.Rmd` file contains inline explanations, code snippets, and exercises.
* There’s an optional "Boss Fight" at the end of every 2-3 chapters — a real-world-style challenge problem that tests what you’ve learned.

## Prerequisites

* A basic understanding of how to open RStudio and run `.Rmd` files.
* Willingness to experiment and fail forward.

## Who This Is For

This material is best for:

* High school graduates or early college students with basic computer literacy.
* Anyone with interest in learning R and data analysis through storytelling and real-world community data.

## Next Steps

After mastering the Foundation, students will move into specific modules where they:

* Choose a Baltimore neighborhood.
* Use BNIA data to answer real community questions.
* Tell data stories using visualizations, summaries, and insights.

Let’s build the foundation strong — and then build Baltimore stories from there!
