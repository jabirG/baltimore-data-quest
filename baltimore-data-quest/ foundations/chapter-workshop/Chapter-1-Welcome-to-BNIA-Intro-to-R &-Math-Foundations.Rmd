# 🎮 Stage 1: Welcome + Using the BNIA Website

Welcome to your **first adventure** as a data explorer!\
This is where you learn that **real-world data lives in places like BNIA (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance).**

> **BNIA Website:** <https://bniajfi.org>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🕹️ Mini-Mission: Explore the BNIA Website

1.  Visit **BNIA**.
2.  Click on **"Vital Signs"**.
3.  Locate your **Community Statistical Area (CSA)**.
4.  Browse through different **Indicators** — pick one that interests you.

*This step is about getting familiar with where data comes from, not analyzing it yet.*

> **Data Points Earned: 10** *(Beginner – Familiarization)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ⚔️ Stage 2: Why Learn R?

R is a programming language made **specifically for statistics and data**.\
Before we analyze Baltimore data, we must learn the **language of numbers**.

> Data scientists are like detectives: R is your magnifying glass, and math is your logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🏗 Stage 3: Assigning Values – Objects

The most basic thing in R: **assignment**.

```{r}
# Assign a number to an object


# Assign a word (text) to an object


# Assign a vector (a group of values)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 📊 Stage 4: Math in R

R was made for math. Try these using the `scores` object from the backend chapter:

```{r}
# Mean (average)


# Median (middle value)


# Minimum and Maximum


# Sum


# Standard deviation (how spread out)


```

These **built-in functions** will be your best friends. Anytime you have a set of numbers, you can summarize them quickly.

> **Pro Tip:** Never be afraid of math in R. The language was created for it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧩 Quick Practice

Try:

1.  Create an object called `ages` with 5 numbers of your choice.
2.  Use `mean()`, `median()`, and `sd()` on `ages`.

```{r}


```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🔮 Stage 5: Using Built-in Data

R has **built-in datasets** ready to explore. For example, `mtcars`, look at the first few rows:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

This dataset is about cars: miles per gallon, horsepower, weight, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧙‍♂️ Mini-Boss Fight – The Statistician’s Ghost

**Description:** The Statistician’s Ghost tries to confuse you by hiding patterns in **numbers**. Your task: use R’s math functions to reveal them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Your Mission**

Using the `mtcars` dataset:

1.  Find the **average mpg (miles per gallon)**.
2.  Find the **median horsepower (hp)**.
3.  Find the **minimum and maximum weight (wt)**.
4.  Use `sd()` to see how much mpg varies.

Write your answers in a code chunk:

```{r}



```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Victory Condition:** Once you answer all 5, the Ghost vanishes.

**Reward:**

-   40 Data Points
-   Badge: **Math Adept**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 Reflection

-   Which math function surprised you?
-   Which one do you think will be most useful in data analysis?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧙 Next Chapter

Great work! You’ve explored real data sources and learned **how to use math as a weapon**.
