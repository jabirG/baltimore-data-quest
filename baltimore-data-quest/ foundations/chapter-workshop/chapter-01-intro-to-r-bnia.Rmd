# 🎮 Stage 1: Welcome + Using the BNIA Website

In this first stage, you'll learn how to use the BNIA (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance) website to find data we'll use throughout this course.

🧠 *Main Objective*: Understand where our real-world data comes from and how to find it.

**🔗 BNIA Website**: [https://bniajfi.org](https://bniajfi.org)

### 🕹️ Mini-Mission: Explore the BNIA Website

* Visit the BNIA website.
* Click on **"Vital Signs"**.
* Find your Community Statistical Area (CSA).
* Browse through the different **Indicators** — pick one that interests you.

> 📝 *Note for Instructors:*
> This is where you can embed a walkthrough video or link to the official BNIA module PDF.

# ⚔️ Stage 2: Intro to R + RStudio

We're going to start coding in R — the tool you'll use to work with your data!

🧠 *Main Objective*: Learn about vectors, the assignment operator, and basic R commands.

```{r}
# Assigning a number to a variable
x <- 5

# Creating a vector
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Checking the type of data
typeof(my_vector)
```

## 🧩 Core Concepts

* `x <- 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`.
* `c()` stands for **concatenate** or **combine**. It's how you make vectors in R.
* A **vector** is a group of values in a single object.
* The `|>` operator is the new “pipe”(which is known as "and then" or "then this happened") that passes results forward to the next function.

```{r}
# Example with new pipe
c(1, 2, 3) |> sum()
```

> 🧠 *You can use `%>%` or `|>` — they do the same thing. But we'll use `|>` to teach the modern standard.*

# ❓ Real Questions New Students Might Ask (and That’s Okay!)

> 🤔 **"What does `c()` mean?"**
> 💡 It means "combine" or "concatenate." It's how you create a list of values.

> 🤔 **"Why do I need the `<-` instead of `=`?"**
> 💡 You can technically use `=`, but `<-` is the convention in R. It's clearer when you're assigning a value.

> 🤔 **"Why do we start a new line after each `|>`?"**
> 💡 It's easier to read. Just like paragraphs in writing, spacing helps you understand the flow of your code.

# 🧱 Add-On: Digging Deeper (Optional)

```{r}
# Try assigning your own vector of favorite numbers
favorites <- c(7, 14, 21)

# Find the average
favorites |> mean()
```

> ✍️ *NOTE: You can expand this section with more practice exercises, reflection questions, or group discussion prompts.*

# 🧠 Recap

You’ve completed your first lesson!

* ✅ You visited BNIA and found your first dataset.
* ✅ You wrote your first lines of R code.
* ✅ You learned what vectors, assignment, and the pipe operator are.

# 🧙‍♂️ Boss Fight Incoming

🧪 **Mini-Quiz (Boss Fight)**

Write R code to:

1. Assign your neighborhood’s name to a variable.
2. Create a vector of 3 values from your chosen indicator.
3. Use `|>` to calculate the mean.

🎯 Your mission: Submit your code and a screenshot of the indicator you found. FYI below is how to create a code chunk or automatically do it with the green icon with a white c in the middle above.
```{r}

```

# 🧙 Final Comment

> There are no dumb questions. If you're unsure — ask. Every coder, even the pros, started where you are.
