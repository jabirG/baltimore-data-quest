# 🎨 Chapter 4 – Data Visualization & Storytelling

In this chapter, we will explore the **power of visualization** using `ggplot2` (part of the tidyverse).  
This is where numbers and data **become visual stories** that others can understand at a glance.

---

## 🎯 Main Objective

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Use `ggplot2` to create different visualizations  
- Understand why we choose specific `geoms` for different situations  
- Make decisions based on data patterns, not just tables  
- Prepare for **Side Quests** on trend prediction and customization

---

# 🏹 Stage 1 – Why Visualization?

Numbers in a table can feel like a forest where you can’t see the trees.  
**Plots are your map.** They help you:

- Spot **trends** (e.g., is something increasing or decreasing?)
- Spot **outliers** (something that stands out as unusual)
- Spot **patterns** (relationships between two or more variables)

We will use **`ggplot2`** because it is:
- Consistent, flexible, and powerful
- Built on the “grammar of graphics” idea

---

# 🏹 Stage 2 – Basic Structure of ggplot2

We will always use this **pipeline** style:

```{r}
data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) |>
  geom_point()
```

* `data` = your dataset
* `aes()` = aesthetic mapping (what goes on the x/y axes)
* `geom_*` = the type of visualization (points, bars, etc.)

---

## 10 Commonly Used Geoms

1. `geom_point()` – scatter plots
2. `geom_bar()` – bar charts
3. `geom_col()` – bar charts with explicit y-values
4. `geom_histogram()` – histograms
5. `geom_boxplot()` – boxplots (spread of data)
6. `geom_line()` – line charts (trends over time)
7. `geom_area()` – filled line plots
8. `geom_smooth()` – trend lines
9. `geom_violin()` – distribution shapes
10. `geom_density()` – smooth distributions

*(There are many more! We’ll also see when to use these in practice.)*

# 🏹 Stage 3 – Example: Scatter Plot with `mpg` dataset

We’ll use the built-in `mpg` dataset.
We want to see if **engine size (displ)** affects **highway mileage (hwy)**.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) |>
  geom_point()
```

---

## Discussion

* Scatter plots (`geom_point()`) are perfect for **relationships between two numeric variables.**
* Look for patterns: is hwy going down as engine size increases?

---

# 🏹 Stage 4 – Adding Color

We can add a **third variable** visually by mapping a color:

```{r}
mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) |>
  geom_point()
```

Now you can see **different car classes**.

---

# 🏹 Stage 5 – Adding a Trend Line

Sometimes data looks noisy.
We can add a **trend line** with `geom_smooth()`:

```{r}
mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) |>
  geom_point() |>
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

# ❗ Mini Boss – **The Critic**

The Critic says:

> "You have all these numbers… but can you show me a story?
> Make a plot that shows:
>
> * Which variables are related
> * A clear trend
> * A clear title and labels
> * Use at least 2 geoms (like `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`)."

**Task:**

Use **any dataset you want**.
Create a **beautiful plot** showing a relationship and trend.

---

**Submit:**

* A plot that tells a clear story
* Title and labels
* 2 geoms in one visualization

**Points:** 75 DP

---

# 🧠 Recap

* You learned how to use `ggplot2` to visualize relationships
* You know when to choose `geom_point()`, `geom_line()`, etc.
* You created a **plot that tells a story**
