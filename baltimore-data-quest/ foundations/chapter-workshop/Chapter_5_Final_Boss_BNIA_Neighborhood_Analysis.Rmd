# 🧠 Chapter 5: Final Boss — Neighborhood Deep Dive

> **Rank:** S-Rank
> **Difficulty:** Advanced 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
> **Points Possible:** 200 DP

---

## 🎬 The Final Act

After your journey through R — from wrangling data to visualizing insights — the final boss appears: a **corrupt overseer of Baltimore neighborhoods**. Twisting data to hide disparities, they’ve blurred the truths behind housing, internet access, safety, and investment in our city.

You’ve learned the tools to fight back.

Now, it’s time to **analyze your neighborhood** with real BNIA data, craft your own data-driven question, and reveal a compelling story that exposes or celebrates the truths of your chosen CSA (Community Statistical Area).

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

This is your **first full project** as a data scientist. You’ve been equipped with the training — now it’s up to you to decide:

* What neighborhood matters to you?
* What question will guide your analysis?
* What insights will you discover and visualize?

You may pull from:

* BNIA Excel sheets
* External public data sources (optional)

> ⚠️ **Reminder**: Download the categories you want from [BNIA’s Vital Signs Data](https://bniajfi.org/vital-signs/). Clean your data. Think deeply.

## 🛠️ Expected Tools

You are expected to use skills from all previous chapters and side quests:

✅ `tidyverse` functions: `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`
✅ `lubridate`, `janitor`, and proper use of the pipe `|>`
✅ `ggplot2`: Create at least **two meaningful visuals** with proper labeling and customization
✅ One **statistical insight** using `mean()`, `median()`, or other math-based function
✅ A written explanation or mini-report interpreting your findings

## 🧙‍♂️ Final Boss: The Shadow of Data

> **Name:** Corvexus Null
>
> **Backstory:** Once a data guardian, Corvexus grew obsessed with **manipulating reality** through incomplete statistics. He hides systemic issues by selectively showing data — and it’s up to you to defeat him by revealing the **truth** of your CSA.

---

## 🎓 Submission Format

You will submit:

* An `.Rmd` or `.html` report formatted like a professional data product.
* Screenshots or links to BNIA data sources you used.
* A 3-minute presentation (optional but encouraged) explaining your findings.
