# 🏹 Side Quest Project: Seeing the Future
*(Extension of Chapter 4 – Visualization & Market Insights)*

**Goal:**  
Predict trends in company sales based on advertising spending on **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper**.  
You will be graded step-by-step using **Data Points (DP)**.

> Complete all stages to earn **120 DP (Advanced)**.  
> This project prepares you for **Chapter 5’s final boss**.

---

# Stage 1 – Data Setup (20 DP)

### 1. Load the Dataset

```{r}
#Load your packages and your data from the data folder


```

**Checkpoint:**
Write a line of code to:

1. Display the first 10 rows
2. Count how many rows there are in this dataset

```{r}
# Your code here

```

> **Earn 20 DP:**
> If you can load, preview, and count rows correctly.

---

# Stage 2 – Visualizing Relationships (30 DP)

We will explore **Sales vs each advertising channel**.

### Example (TV vs Sales):

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ads |>
  ggplot(aes(x = TV, y = Sales)) |>
  geom_point() |>
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) |>
  labs(
    title = "TV Ad Spend vs Sales",
    x = "TV Ad Spend (thousands)",
    y = "Sales (thousands)"
  )
```

---

### Your Turn:

1. Make a **scatter plot with trend line** for **Radio vs Sales**
2. Make a **scatter plot with trend line** for **Newspaper vs Sales**

```{r}
# Your Radio plot here

```

```{r}
# Your Newspaper plot here

```

> **Earn 30 DP:**
> Both plots correct and easy to read.

---

# Stage 3 – Correlation Analysis (20 DP)

Correlation shows **how strongly two variables move together**.

Write code to calculate the **correlation matrix** for TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales.

```{r}
# Your code here

```

> **Hint:** Use `select()` to choose columns, then `cor()`.

> **Earn 20 DP:** Correct correlation table.

---

# Stage 4 – Mini Boss: **The Corporate Executive (Target)** (50 DP)

> *“I need a data-driven strategy for our ad budget.
> Which ad channel is the strongest? Which is weakest? Show me evidence.”*

**Your Task:**

1. Use your three scatter plots and correlation table.
2. Write a **3-point strategy** answering:

   * Which advertising type works best?
   * Which one works the least?
   * Your advice for the future.

Write your answer here (in bullet points):

```
- 
- 
-
```

> **Earn 50 DP:** If your explanation matches the evidence.

---

# Bonus: Predict Future Sales (Optional +15 DP)

Use a **linear regression model** to predict **Sales** if:

* TV = 200
* Radio = 40
* Newspaper = 10

```{r}
# Example model
model <- lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper, data = ads)

# Your prediction:
```

---

# 💰 Total Data Points

* Stage 1: 20 DP
* Stage 2: 30 DP
* Stage 3: 20 DP
* Mini Boss: 50 DP
* Bonus: +15 DP

**Total: 120 DP (or 135 DP with bonus)**

# Reflection

This project taught you how to:

* Visualize relationships
* Quantify correlations
* Provide actionable business advice
* Build a predictive model

These skills are directly connected to **real-world data science and analytics**.
