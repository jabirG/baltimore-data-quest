Here’s a refined version of the **"Side Quest"** for your curriculum—designed to sharpen mindset, motivation, and analytical thinking *before* diving into coding. This will serve as foundational mental prep, like the tutorial level before the first dungeon.

## 🌱 Side Quest: Cultivating the Data Science Mindset

---

### 🔑 **Quest Objective**

Before we write a single line of code, we’re going to upgrade how we think. This side quest helps you reshape how you **ask questions**, **consume information**, and **observe the world**. These skills form the *foundation* of every great data scientist.

## 🧠 Side Quest Breakdown

### 📍**Quest 1: How to Ask Data-Driven Questions**

> *"The quality of your data is only as useful as the quality of your question."*

#### 🧩 Talking Point:

* Think like a detective. You're not just *looking* at data—you’re *interrogating* it.
* Avoid vague questions like: “Is this good or bad?” Instead ask: “How did X change over time in Y neighborhood?”

#### 🧠 Thought Expansion:

* Show examples of transforming a broad topic into specific questions using BNIA indicators.
* Teach the difference between **descriptive**, **diagnostic**, and **predictive** questions.

✅ **Challenge Activity:**
Pick one BNIA indicator (like “Percent of Households with No Internet”) and write 3 data-driven questions about it.

---

### 📍**Quest 2: Think Analytically, Not Emotionally**

> *"To see clearly, we must detach. Let the data lead."*

#### 🧩 Talking Point:

* Explain **analytical thinking** as observing *patterns, connections, and causes*—not personal opinions or assumptions.
* Emotions are valid—but in analysis, we look for **evidence**.

#### 🧠 Thought Expansion:

* Introduce logical fallacies like confirmation bias.
* Practice turning hunches into **testable hypotheses**.

✅ **Challenge Activity:**
Take a common claim from the media (“Crime is increasing in my city”). Use BNIA to find supporting or contradicting data.

---

### 🌌 **Optional Side Quest: Media Literacy + Deeper Meaning in Content**

> *"Behind every story is a data layer—what’s being said, what’s being hidden, and why."*

#### 🧩 Talking Point:

* Decode media like The Sandman or a news headline.
* Teach students to ask:

  * Who created this?
  * What is the message?
  * What data or evidence is being shown?
  * What is being *left out*?

#### 🧠 Thought Expansion:

* Use an episode from *The Sandman* as a metaphor: e.g., how Dream reflects order, Desire reflects manipulation, etc.
* Tie this into data: Just like the Endless shape reality, **data shapes perception**.

✅ **Challenge Activity:**
Watch a scene from a show (or a TikTok trend). Write what the creators want the viewer to feel. Then, think: what story would the **data** behind it tell?
