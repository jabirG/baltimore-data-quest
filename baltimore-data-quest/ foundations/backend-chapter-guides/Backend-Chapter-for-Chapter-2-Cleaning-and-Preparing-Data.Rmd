# 📂 Backend Chapter for Chapter 2: Cleaning and Preparing Data

Welcome to the back-end breakdown of Chapter 2. This section will serve as your data wizard's grimoire — your deeper dive into **how** and **why** we did what we did. Think of this like peeking behind the curtain to understand the design of the spell, not just the spell itself.

> 🧠 **Note:** This chapter is for building mastery. If Chapter 2 felt like training in the field, this is your time in the strategy room.

## 🧰 Why We Use `tidyverse`

The `tidyverse` is like equipping yourself with a toolbelt where all the tools are designed to work together. Instead of mixing mismatched utilities, everything speaks the same language — elegant, readable, and powerful.

### 🔍 What's Inside `tidyverse`?

The core packages include:

* **`ggplot2`** – for creating graphics and visualizations
* **`dplyr`** – for data wrangling (filtering, selecting, mutating, summarizing)
* **`tidyr`** – for reshaping data (pivoting, unnesting, separating, uniting)
* **`readr`** – for reading data (CSV, TSV, etc.) quickly and cleanly
* **`purrr`** – for functional programming and mapping functions
* **`tibble`** – for a cleaner, modern version of `data.frame`

### 🤔 Why not just base R?

Base R is powerful, but not always intuitive. `tidyverse` provides **consistent syntax** and **function chaining** (`%>%` or `|>`) that make your data cleaning easier to follow.

## 🧼 Why Clean This Way?

### 🧾 Why Use `janitor::clean_names()`?

Sometimes, column names have weird formatting, like spaces or capital letters. This function turns your column names into `snake_case`, making them easier to work with.

> **Other options:**
> You could manually rename columns with `names(df) <- c("col1", "col2", ...)`, but that gets tedious fast. `clean_names()` automates it.

### 🧪 Why Filter with `filter()` Instead of Indexing?

```{r}
filter(data, condition)
```

vs.

```{r}
data[data$col == value, ]
```

Filtering with `dplyr` is more **readable** and **chainable** in pipelines. Especially useful in large or nested data operations.

> ✅ Think of it like Lego blocks — each step is clear and modular.

### 🔍 When to Use `select()`

Use this to:

* Drop unnecessary columns
* Reorder columns
* Focus attention on relevant features for your analysis

Instead of writing `data[, c("name", "age")]`, you can use `select(data, name, age)` or the below code, which is much more readable.

```{r}
# or instead of using select(data, name, age) which will not be acceptable in this class. I much rather see you use the code below which does the same thing but looks cleaner.

data |>
  select(name, age)

```

## 🆘 The Help Panel and Discovering Functions

### 🔍 Finding Out What a Function Does

* Use `?function_name` (e.g., `?filter`) to bring up the documentation
* Use `args(function_name)` to see the argument structure

FYI not a dumb question: "Do i include the backticks?" No the backticks are there for the course, otherwise ignore the backticks when writing your own code.

### 🧠 Side Tip:

Use the **Help Panel** in RStudio. It will auto-complete function names and show documentation.

> Students often ask:
> **"How do I know what a function is expecting?"**
>
> > ✅ Use `?function`, `help(function)`, or explore the Help panel.
> or ask your instructor!

## 🔄 Other Ways to Do It

### ✨ Base R alternatives

* `subset()` instead of `filter()`
* `colnames()` to rename instead of `rename()`
* `apply()` or `sapply()` instead of `mutate()`

These are valid, but they often don’t chain well or read as clearly.

### 🧙‍♂️ Special Cases

Some edge cases might require:

* `stringr` for complex string cleaning
* `lubridate` for dealing with date/time data
* `forcats` for working with categorical/factor variables

All part of the tidyverse toolkit — each used depending on the data situation.
