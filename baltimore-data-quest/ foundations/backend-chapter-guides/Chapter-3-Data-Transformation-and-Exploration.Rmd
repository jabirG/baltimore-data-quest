# 🏰 Backend Chapter – Data Transformation & Exploration

You’ve survived the Lens of Truth.  
Now, step into the **Hall of Insight**, where the techniques of *transformation* and *exploration* are revealed.  

This backend guide is your **strategy scroll**. Before you set foot in the front-line chapter, take time here to master the tools that turn **clean data into powerful discoveries**.

---

## Why Transform and Explore?

Cleaning and selecting columns was like clearing fog from a battlefield.  
But **just seeing clearly isn’t enough** — you need to look for patterns, relationships, and meaning.

This chapter focuses on:

* Summarizing data
* Grouping data
* Creating new columns
* Counting patterns
* Beginning your first visual explorations

---

# 🧰 The Core Spells of Transformation

Here are the **key functions** you’ll wield in the upcoming chapter.  

Think of them as **combat techniques**:

---

## 1. `group_by()`

**What it does:**  
Groups your dataset by a category so that any operations you do afterward will be **done separately for each group**.

**Why it matters:**  
Without grouping, every summary is over the whole dataset. With grouping, you get **insight per genre, per year, per language**, etc.

```{r}
movies |>
  group_by(genre_names)
````

---

## 2. `summarise()`

**What it does:**
Collapses your grouped data into **summary statistics**.

**Example:**
Find the average revenue by genre.

```{r}
movies |>
  group_by(genre_names) |>
  summarise(avg_revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE))
```

> **Notice:** `na.rm = TRUE` removes missing values.

---

## 3. `mutate()`

**What it does:**
Adds **new columns** to your dataset based on calculations you make.

**Example:**
Calculate **profit** (revenue minus budget).

```{r}
movies |>
  mutate(profit = revenue - budget)
```

---

## 4. `arrange()`

**What it does:**
Re-orders rows by a column (ascending or descending).

**Example:**
Arrange movies by **highest profit**.

```{r}
movies |>
  mutate(profit = revenue - budget) |>
  arrange(desc(profit))
```

---

## 5. `count()`

**What it does:**
Quickly counts occurrences of a value in a column.

**Example:**
Count how many movies fall into each original language.

```{r}
movies |>
  count(original_language)
```

This is a shorthand for `group_by(original_language)` followed by `summarise(n = n())`.

---

## 6. **ggplot2: Your First Visual Weapon**

`ggplot2` helps you **see patterns in your data**. The grammar of graphics lets you build a plot step by step.

Example: Popularity by release year.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

movies |>
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(release_date)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Key components:**

* `aes()` defines what goes on the x and y axes.
* `geom_point()` makes a scatterplot.
* `theme_minimal()` makes it clean and simple.

# 🧭 Strategy Tips for the Front-End Chapter

### 1. Start Small

Don’t try to do everything at once. First group, then summarize. Then mutate. Then visualize.

### 2. Keep an Eye on Missing Data

Use `na.rm = TRUE` or `drop_na()` when necessary. Missing data can break your flow.

### 3. Build Pipelines Step-by-Step

Run each chunk before adding more. Pipelines can grow long, but they’re easy to debug if you test as you go.

### 4. Visualizations Are Weapons

Patterns often hide until you **see** them. Use `ggplot2` like a telescope.

---

# 🧪 Practice Before the Boss

To prepare for the next chapter’s mini-boss, practice these:

```{r}
# Try this:
movies |>
  mutate(profit = revenue - budget) |>
  group_by(genre_names) |>
  summarise(avg_profit = mean(profit, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_profit))
```

Questions to consider:

* Which genre has the highest average profit?
* Are there genres with low profit but high popularity?

---

# 🔮 What’s Coming in Chapter 3 (Front-End)

In the **front-end chapter**, you’ll:

* Use these skills to **spot patterns in movie data**.
* Prepare to face a **Mini-Boss that thrives on confusion** – the “Phantom of Patterns” – who hides valuable insights across multiple columns.
* Defeat it by summarizing and visualizing patterns that **no confusion can obscure**.

---

**Next stop:**

> **Chapter 3 – Data Transformation & Exploration (Front-End)**
> Your new challenge: **Extract patterns, build insights, and prepare to see the unseen.**

---


### What this backend chapter does:

* Explains **all functions conceptually and technically** that will be used.
* Provides **practice chunks** without giving the final mini-boss away.
* Sets up **the narrative for Chapter 3 front-end**, where the students will have to use these tools.
* Ensures consistency with your previous backend style.
