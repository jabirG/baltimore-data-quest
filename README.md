## ✨ Teaching Style

This course blends exploration with structure. Each module:
- Has its own lesson and challenge

- Builds on the last while staying flexible for all levels

You can **fast-track** through early material if you're already experienced — or take your time and build your power level step by step. 🧙🏾
